  @file orientation.py
  @brief When detecting the orientation of the module, the sensor can detect the following six events:
  @n Positive z-axis is facing up
  @n Positive z-axis is facing down
  @n Positive y-axis is facing up
  @n Positive y-axis is facing down
  @n Positive x-axis is facing up
  @n Positive x-axis is facing down
  @n When using SPI, chip select pin can be modified by changing the value of RASPBERRY_PIN_CS
