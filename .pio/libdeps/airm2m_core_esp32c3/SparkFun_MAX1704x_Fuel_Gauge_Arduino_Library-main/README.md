The MAX17043/MAX17044 are ultra-compact, low-cost,
host-side fuel-gauge systems for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries
in handheld and portable equipment. The MAX17043
is configured to operate with a single lithium cell and the
MAX17044 is configured for a dual-cell 2S pack.

The MAX17048/MAX17049 ICs are tiny, micropower current
fuel gauges for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld
and portable equipment. The MAX17048 operates with
a single lithium cell and the MAX17049 with two lithium
cells in series.

This Arduino library provides support for all four devices.
