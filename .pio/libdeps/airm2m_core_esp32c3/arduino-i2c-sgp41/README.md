# Installation

To install, download the latest release as .zip file and add it to your
[Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) via

	Sketch => Include Library => Add .ZIP Library...

Don't forget to **install the dependencies** listed below the same way via `Add
.ZIP Library`

Note: Installation via the Arduino Library Manager is coming soon.

# Dependencies

* [Sensirion Core](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-core)


# Quick Start

1. Connect the SGP41 Sensor to your Arduino board's standard
   I2C bus. Check the pinout of your Arduino board to find the correct pins.
   The pinout of the SGP41 Sensor board can be found in the
   data sheet.

	* **VDD** of the SEK-SGP41 to the **3.3V** of your Arduino board
	* **GND** of the SEK-SGP41 to the **GND** of your Arduino board
	* **SCL** of the SEK-SGP41 to the **SCL** of your Arduino board
	* **SDA** of the SEK-SGP41 to the **SDA** of your Arduino board

2. Open the `exampleUsage` sample project within the Arduino IDE

		File => Examples => Sensirion I2C SGP41 => exampleUsage

3. Click the `Upload` button in the Arduino IDE or

		Sketch => Upload

4. When the upload process has finished, open the `Serial Monitor` or `Serial
   Plotter` via the `Tools` menu to observe the measurement values. Note that
   the `Baud Rate` in the corresponding window has to be set to `115200 baud`.

# Conditioning

After each restart of the sensor or when the hotplates have been switched off, the conditioning command must
be called from idle mode. The conditioning heats the hotplate of the NOx pixel to a different temperature compared
to the measurement mode enabling a faster switch-on thereafter.

It is recommended to execute the conditioning for 10s, but **10s must not be exceeded** to avoid damage to the sensing material.

# Contributing

**Contributions are welcome!**

We develop and test this driver using our company internal tools (version
control, continuous integration, code review etc.) and automatically
synchronize the master branch with GitHub. But this doesn't mean that we don't
respond to issues or don't accept pull requests on GitHub. In fact, you're very
welcome to open issues or create pull requests :)

This Sensirion library uses
[`clang-format`](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) to standardize the
formatting of all our `.cpp` and `.h` files. Make sure your contributions are
formatted accordingly:

The `-i` flag will apply the format changes to the files listed.

```bash
clang-format -i src/*.cpp src/*.h
```

Note that differences from this formatting will result in a failed build until
they are fixed.
